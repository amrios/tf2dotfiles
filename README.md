# Personal TF2 Configuration
This is my personal TF2 configuration. It is supposed to be ran via a Bash script for setup, however you can follow the steps in the README for a manual setup. The script expects that you are running in Linux or Windows via WSL2.

## Mastercomfig
Use the constants Mastercomfig links to retrieve the latest plugins.

## HUD (Yayahud)
I use my own personal fork of Yayahud. This fork includes fixes for some alignment problems that I have noticed.

## Hitsound
The classic Quake 3 hitsound is provided. The configuration also has `tf_dingaling_pitch*` convars set.

## `/overrides/`
Mastercomfig related config overrides

## `/tf/`
This directory is a placeholder. The script will fill this directory with the proper configuration upon running it.
